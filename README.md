## SYPNOSIS ##
3D animation and physics project: Ragdoll Dismemberment

The purpose of our project is to explore and take advantage of physics simulations to animate a ragdoll, in particular exploring how spring systems can be used to stretch and deform objects.

## MOTIVATION ##

This project was chosen since we were interested in learning about how physics can be used to create realistic animations

## INSTALLATION

This project can be runned by executing the build file (.exe) or by opening the project in Unit

## EXTERNAL RESOURCES ##

We used Unity engine to render the graphics and handle some physics components.

And for the scenery we used assets directly from the unity asset store, in particular the following two assets:
Handpainted Forest Environment Free Sample
Low Poly Environment
