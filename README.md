## SYPNOSIS ##
3D animation and physics project: Ragdoll Dismemberment

The purpose of our project is to explore and take advantage of physics simulations to animate a ragdoll, in particular exploring how spring systems can be used to stretch and deform objects.

## MOTIVATION ##

This project was chosen since we were interested in learning about how physics can be used to create realistic animations

## INSTALLATION

This project can be runned by executing the build file (.exe) or by opening the project in Unit
